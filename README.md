# Layered-Sensing-Platform-for-Human-Exoskeleton-Interaction

This repository demonstrates the datasets and machine learning models code for the research manuscript:"A layered smart sensing platform for physiologically informed human-exoskeleton interaction"

## 🔍 Core Tasks

This system supports three key perception tasks critical for safe and adaptive human–exoskeleton interaction:

1. **Task I – Joint Moment Estimation**  
   Predicts the wearer’s joint torque, enabling intent-aware motion assistance.

2. **Task II – Metabolic Effort Monitoring**  
   Tracks real-time changes in metabolic energy consumption under varying assistive conditions.

3. **Task III – Injury Risk Detection**  
   Detects external mechanical overload or anomalous strain patterns to prevent unsafe torque application.

Each task is implemented as an independent neural module and evaluated under task-specific experimental conditions across lab, outdoor, and risk-triggered scenarios.
